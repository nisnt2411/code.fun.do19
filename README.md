# code.fun.do19
 Idea for code fun do++ 2019(Team code_geeks).
 Points we will cover in this project are :
1. We will make a site where individuals can submit any suspicious activity in the polling booth and the respected query will be send to a nearby police station or any respected body with the location of the booth.
2. There will be a section where people can mark that if they have casted the vote or not so we could calculate the voting percentage.
3. There will be section where all the required information about all the candidates will be provided, people can rate and also comment on candidates manifestos.
